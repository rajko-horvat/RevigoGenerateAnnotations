## Repository description
<p>This is the command line utility that generates Species Annotations REVIGO uses to process data and create Similarity Matrix. 
The utility is computationaly intensive and threaded (parallelized). Be careful when you specify number of cores your CPU has.</p>

## About REVIGO (REduce + VIsualize Gene Ontology) project
<p>Outcomes of high-throughput biological experiments are typically interpreted by statistical testing
for enriched gene functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology (GO). The resulting lists of GO terms 
may be large and highly redundant, and thus difficult to interpret.<p>
<p>REVIGO is a successful project to summarize long, unintelligible lists of Gene Ontology terms by finding a representative subset 
of the terms using a simple clustering algorithm that relies on semantic similarity measures.</p>
